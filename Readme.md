## Flow Mapping Plots

This was a study of flow of a air tunnel. The tunnel has 500x500mm of section area, and we did measurement of pressure each 50mm until complete 400x400mm section area, using a Pitot Tube with the a digital manometer, thus totaling 81 points of pressure measured. Was realized three mappings, each in different distance from the begin of tunnel face, the first mapping was done with 50mm of distance of begin of the tunnel, the next mappings was 200mm and 300mm. For the each mapping was generated a matrix of this results, with the coordinates of each pressure.

## Plotting the mappings

Below we can see the heatmaps of mappings of each distance.

## Final Result

The final result is a gif of the heat map that goes 50mm until 300mm with an interpolation of intermediate results.
